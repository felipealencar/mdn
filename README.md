Model-Driven Networking
===


Model-Driven Networking (MDN) is a modeling framework to create and describe applications and environments in Software-Defined Networking (SDN). This is a Brazilian project supported by the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) and the Foundation for Supporting the Science and Technology of Pernambuco (FACEPE). It arose aiming to raise the abstraction level for developing SDN applications, and now it is focused on identifying the benefits of a model-based approach for the SDN field.

This repository contains both the source code and the MDN editor that could be used to model SDN applications.
